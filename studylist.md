# Post-Graduation Study List

Your education doesn't stop after graduation. In truth, your NSS experience is only the very beginning. By entering the field of software development you've committed yourself to a career of regular learning. (Some people would say "constant learning", but _constant_ is maybe a bit much..._regular_ is plenty)

These are some items you may want to explore after graduation. This list is **NOT** in a priority order. It's up to you to decide what your priorities are. Also, this list is just a place to start. You are **strongly** encouraged to make your own list based on your personal preferences and interests, and the kind of job you're seeking. Remember it's much easier to learn things you find interesting, so if something on this list doesn't interest you, it's ok to skip it. There will always be plenty to learn. You're sure to find something that grabs your attention.

Also remember that your list should include things that you learned at NSS, but want to dive deeper into.
