* A model
  * is an abstraction
  * a representation of something
    * often this "something" is in the real world
  * Pick out particular properties of a thing that we care about
  * Ignore the properties that we don't care about.
  * "All models are wrong, but some are useful" -George Box
  * It's important to form mental models when reading and interpreting code

    * weather forecast
    * bank transaction
    * a "car"
