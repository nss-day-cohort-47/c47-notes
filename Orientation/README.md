## Concepts common to most programming languages

* Sequential execution
  * one line of code runs after another
  * one thing happens at a time
  * top-down
  * right to left
    * `let x = 2 + 3;`
* Selection - Conditional Execution
  * Code executes based on some boolean (`true`/`false`) condition
  * `if` statement
  * ternary (`?:`) operator
  * `switch`
* Iteration - looping
  * Doing the same code zero or more times
  * `for` loop
  * `while`
  * C# `foreach` loop is like JavaScript `for ... of` loop
* Objects
  * group of related properties and method/functions
* Collections
  * group of objects
  * in a particular order

## Where does software run?

* JavaScript runs in a Web browser
  * referred to as a "sandbox"
* Code runs lots of places
* Examples
  * self-driving cars
  * ATMs 
  * gas pumps
  * Operating System
    * software that controls the computer and allows other programs to run
    * Windows, MacOS, Linux
  * Video games
  * Desktop Applications
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    * Examples
      * vs code
      * web browser
      * MS Word
      * Video Players
  * Command Line Applications
    * Command Line Interface (CLI)
    * Console Apps
    * Runs in the terminal / console / command line
    * Examples
      * git
      * npm
      * serve
      * json-server
