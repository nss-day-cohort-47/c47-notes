# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Inheritance

* A way to share code between classes.
* A way to relate one class to another
  * Parent class
    * the class being inherited from
    * Super class
    * Base class
  * Child class
    * The class that is inheriting from the parent
    * sub class
    * Derived class
* A class can **only inherit from ONE other class**
  * "Single Inheritance"
* `private` properties, methods and fields are **NOT** inherited

## Interfaces

* another way to write types in C#
* list the `public` methods and properties a class much implement
* do not contain any logic (i.e. no _method bodies_)
* are a kind of "contract" that a class must adhere to
